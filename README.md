## simple extension manager

Due to the fact that [hayden-fr](https://github.com/hayden-fr)/[vscode-extension-pack-manager](https://github.com/hayden-fr/vscode-extension-pack-manager)'s plugin has not been maintained for a long time, and I am not very good at React, I borrowed his ideas and used Vue to rewrite this plugin. Its function is still a simple management extension pack, which can be easily created, deleted, and updated.
