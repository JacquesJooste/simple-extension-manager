## simple extension manager

Due to the fact that [hayden-fr](https://github.com/hayden-fr)/[vscode-extension-pack-manager](https://github.com/hayden-fr/vscode-extension-pack-manager)  has not been maintained for a long time and I am not very good at React, I borrowed his ideas and used Vue to rewrite this plugin. Its function is still to simply create extension pack, then organize extensions and batch prohibit extensions  through extension pack.

The following commands can be used:

- `extension packs:manage` Create custom extension packs
- `extension pack:view` Show custom expansion packs
